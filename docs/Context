You should generally stick with the defaults here. This is for the actual management of machine contexts. The default is 'ucontext' which uses the libc ucontext functions for implementation, however there are alternatives stemming from the simple reason that ucontext is problematic on Darwin - nonexistant on 64-bit, slow, and requiring massive stacks. Instead, there exist assembly implementations (currently for i386, and x86_64, tested only on Darwin). Note that ucontext is fine on linux.
