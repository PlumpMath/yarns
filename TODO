Need to:

* more sync primitives between yarns (condition, semaphore?)
* establish front API
* implement API for blocks
* re-implement all ucontext API for PowerPC
* rewrite profile generation in Python
* scheduler changes - split rescheduling off from select
* scheduler changes - compile all schedulers in different names
* rename SMP scheduler to master scheduler
* build changes - make everything be combined into one native object file and ship that; allows for LLVM LTO + native asm
* move to microsecond accuracy in scheduling
* add profiles for darwin-*-ppc64
* finish README
* implement preemption on darwin
* research preemption on linux
